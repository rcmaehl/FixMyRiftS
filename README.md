## What is FixMyRiftS?

FixMyRiftS is a quick script to toggle the hardware of the Rift S without actually disconnect it and is significantly faster as the Rift S does not need to reboot afterwards.

This program is free and open source. Feel free to download and modify. Please do not sell exact copies.
